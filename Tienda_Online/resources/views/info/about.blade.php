<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1"><i>“WE SPEND OUR LIVES TRYING TO FIT INTO SOCIETY'S STEREOTYPES, WHEN THE MOST FUN IS TO GET AWAY FROM THEM, THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY FIT IN, WHEN YOU DON'T RESPOND TO ANYTHING BUT YOURSELF”</i></p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">We strongly believe that each one of us is different and paradoxically that is precisely what we have in common as a community, the fact of having those differences among us and being proud of it is what unites us as a community where freedom is exalted and labels are rejected, so that each one of us can be the most complete, honest, transparent and proud version of ourselves.</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">Scuffers was born with the purpose of representing every person who is willing to be more real. More alive. More honest with himself. More proud. More ambitious. In short, more HIM.</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">At Scuffers our main focus has always been the product and its quality. Since it started out as such a personal project, we didn't care about making noise or making money. We only cared about making clothes that we would like to wear.</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">We have continued with that philosophy until today and that is what has brought us to where we are, and that’s why we will continue to expand our product and dress you from the bottom to the top. We want Scuffers to be your everyday pick, all through an everyday urban aesthetic and full of light, with a background of exaltation of the personal and differentiating aspects that seek a continuous personal growth. Because it is an ultimate goal where there is always room for more development and growth. Love for the different and unknown. Love for what is close and known. Love for what is foreign. And for what is ours. Above all for what is ours.</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">And of course, in an "about" section we cannot forget the most important thing: FF FAM - You.</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">Everything we have achieved so far has been possible thanks to all of you who have been supporting the brand from minute 1. So thanks.</p>
