    <p class="p1">Shipments to the UK may be delayed slightly longer than normal due to the situation with respect to the European Union. Customs formalities may delay deliveries and, in some cases, may result in additional charges to the customer that must be paid by the customer upon receipt of the package. UPS will notify the customer and it will be the customer's responsibility to pay these fees. For any questions regarding customs clearance, please contact help@scuffers.es for more information/assistance with a shipment.<br></p>

    <p class="p1">There may be additional charges related to import customs for shipments to the following countries:<br><br><span style="color:#404040;"><i>United Kingdom, Ireland, Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland, Georgia, Gibraltar, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Guernsey, Bouvet Island, Isle of Man, Iceland, Åland Islands, Faroe Islands, Jersey, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Mayotte, Montenegro, Norway, Reunion, Serbia, Switzerland, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, Turkey, Ukraine + North America &amp; South America.</i></span><br><br>UPS/GLS will notify the customer and it will be the customer's responsibility to pay these charges. For any questions regarding customs clearance, please contact help@scuffers.es for more information/assistance with a shipment.</p>
    <p class="p1">The addressee shall bear the costs of customs clearance and the payment of any taxes due in accordance with the customs regulations in force in the country of destination, and it is for this reason that the charges arising from the import are not the responsibility of Scuffers, but it is the customer who must pay the customs duties.</p>
    <p class="p1">In case the customer refuses to pay such charges, the shipment will be considered as rejected by the customer and therefore will be sent back to our warehouse, refunding the amount of the purchased garments minus the charges derived from the rejection of the goods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
